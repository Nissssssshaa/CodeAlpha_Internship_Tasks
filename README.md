## Project Details

### 1. Task 1: Web Scraping - Yahoo Finance Historical Data

**Objective:** "Use Python libraries (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy) or automated tools (Octoparse, ParseHub) to extract data from websites."

**Description:**
This project focuses on extracting historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using Python's `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries. It demonstrates the ability to programmatically access web content, parse HTML, and structure the extracted information into a clean dataset.

**Key Features:**
* **Data Extraction:** Fetches historical price and volume data for a specified stock ticker (e.g., AAPL).
* **HTML Parsing:** Utilizes BeautifulSoup to navigate and extract data from complex web page structures.
* **Data Structuring:** Organizes the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
* **Data Persistence:** Saves the extracted data to a CSV file.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Web Scraping, HTTP Requests, HTML Parsing, Data Collection, Data Structuring.

### 2. Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Tips Dataset

**Objective:** "Explore data structure, including variables and data types; Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies; Test hypotheses and validate assumptions using statistics and visualization; Detect potential data issues or problems."

**Description:**
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the `tips` dataset (a classic dataset in data analysis), which contains information about the total bill, tip amount, time of day, day of the week, and diner demographics. 
**Key Features:**
* **Data Loading & Inspection:** Loads data, checks its initial structure, data types, and dimensions.
* **Missing Value Analysis:** Identifies and quantifies missing data points.
* **Descriptive Statistics:** Generates statistical summaries for numerical and categorical variables.
* **Trend & Pattern Identification:** Uses initial visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to uncover relationships between variables (e.g., total bill vs. tip, tip amount by day/time).
* **Hypothesis Testing (Visual):** Visually confirms assumptions like the relationship between total bill and tip amount.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Data Loading, Data Cleaning, Data Inspection, Descriptive Statistics, Missing Value Handling, Basic Data Visualization for EDA, Pattern Recognition.

### 3. Task 3: Data Visualization - Palmer Penguins Dataset

**Objective:** "Transform raw data into visual formats (charts, graphs, dashboards); Use tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn...; Design visuals that enhance understanding and reveal insights clearly; Craft compelling data stories; Build a strong portfolio with impactful and well-designed visualizations."

**Description:**
This project focuses on creating a series of insightful and aesthetically pleasing visualizations using the Palmer Penguins dataset. It demonstrates the ability to translate data into meaningful visual stories, adhering to best practices in data visualization.

**Key Features:**
* **Data Preparation:** Basic cleaning of the dataset to ensure robust plotting.
* **Variety of Plots:** Utilizes `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` to create diverse plot types including histograms, scatter plots, count plots, box plots, and a pair plot.
* **Insight-Driven Design:** Each visualization is designed to answer specific questions about the penguin species (e.g., body mass distribution, bill dimension relationships, population counts by island/sex).
* **Data Storytelling:** Plots are arranged and commented upon to convey a narrative about the dataset's characteristics.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Data Visualization, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Visual Storytelling, Chart Selection, Creating Impactful Visuals.

### 4. Task 4: Sentiment Analysis - Sample Text Data

**Objective:** "Analyze text data to classify it as positive, negative or neutral; Use NLP techniques and lexicons to detect specific emotions; Apply analysis on data from sources like Amazon reviews, social media, and news sites; Understand public opinion and trends through sentiment patterns; Use results to inform marketing, product development, or social insights."

**Description:**
This project performs sentiment analysis on a sample set of text comments, classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral. It demonstrates the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand public opinion and trends in textual data.

**Key Features:**
* **NLP Technique (VADER):** Utilizes NLTK's Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) for lexicon-based sentiment scoring.
* **Sentiment Classification:** Categorizes text comments into 'Positive', 'Negative', and 'Neutral' based on compound sentiment scores.
* **Pattern Analysis:** Visualizes the distribution of sentiment classes and compound scores to understand overall sentiment trends.
* **Real-world Application:** Demonstrates how sentiment analysis can inform business decisions in marketing, product development, and social listening.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Sentiment Analysis, Natural Language Processing (NLP), NLTK, Text Classification, Understanding Public Opinion, Data-driven Insights.
